# spyctl 🕵️‍♂️

A cross-platform surveillance control system built with Rust.

## 🚀 Features

- Spy features (WIP): screen capture
- Websocket communication between master and slave
- Customizable surveillance state
- File system integration for storing screenshots

## 🚦 Getting Started

- Set the correct IP for master server in `src/bin/slave.rs`.
- Run `cargo build --release` to build the project.
- The `./target/release/master` and `./target/release/slave` executables will be generated.
- Run the `master` executable on the master machine and the `slave` executable on the slave machine.

Need to cross compile for another OS? Use the fantastic [Cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) tool! E.g:

```bash
cargo install cross --git https://github.com/cross-rs/cross
cross build --bin slave --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```
